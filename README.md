After 20 years of music making with different orchestras and ensembles around the world, I wanted a new challenge and a change from my touring life. As a creative individual, seeing how the music industry could benefit from having a closer and broader relationship with modern technology, I decided to take the plunge to join the 16-week [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com) bootcamp.
 
Having recently completed the course, I was able to develop skills and processes in line with best industry practices. I love the process of taking small steps and patiently observing how those small steps evolve into something grand and beautiful. I enjoy writing clean and well-tested code and like to spend time perfecting user experience and accessibility. Since graduating from Makers, I have been launching myself into learning HTML, CSS and React to boost my front-end skills.
 
As a performer, I have collaborated with many different organizations; these include not only the usual symphony orchestras, but also organizations like pop and rock artists and even private functions for members of the Royal Family. This has given me a great deal of experience of working with people from various cultures and disciplines. As a teacher, I established my ability to engage with my students according to their individual personalities. These experiences, and the abilities I have accumulated over the years, have also formed my pragmatic approach to solving problems.
 
As a musician, I enjoy myself most when performing in groups. It is the communication, support and knowledge sharing that makes the whole experience exhilarating. Similarly, I hope to look for a front-end or full-stack junior developer role in a supportive and nurturing environment where I can contribute my knowledge and continue to develop my potential.

## Experience

**Self-employed Violinist** (2006 to current) 
- Collaborated with various major organizations, these include [Philharmonia Orchestrea](https://philharmonia.co.uk/), [BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcsso), [New Zealand Symphony Orchestra](https://www.nzso.co.nz/) and [National Theatre](https://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/)
- Time management. In order to succeed in the freelance field, I have to be very strict with my schedule. I have a concert diary in order to keep track of my performance engagements and auditions, as well as constantly finding space to schedule practice time to refine my playing skills. 
- Flexibility in taking up new skills in a short period. When I was working in the National Theatre for the play "Amadeus", I was asked to learn to act and to improvise movements on stage while playing my instrument, which I had never encountered elsewhere in my playing career; within a period of 3 weeks, I was proudly performing this way on stage with ease.
 
**Violin Teacher** (2003 to current) 
- Compassionate Empathy. When teaching, I openly encourage my students to ask me as many questions as possible. With this approach, I can have a clearer picture of what they are working on or struggling with; then I can figure out how to help them best.
- Imaginative knowledge sharing. I enjoy finding different interpretations of the same concept when explaining to my students. I believe that everyone has a different way to learn, and that the key is to tailor my teaching to each student's needs.
 
**Glass Ceiling Orchestra** (2018) 
Orchestra Fixer<br>
Booking players for the ensemble based on concert projects. Major responsibilities include:
- finding the right players for the instrumental requirement of the repertoire
- booking players that would work well in a team
- being able to find a good replacement on short notice.
 
 
## Skills
 
#### Discipline
In order to become a professional violinist at the highest international level, I have had to be tremendously disciplined, practising 3-4 hours a day for over ten years.
 
#### Team Work
Being a freelance musician, my work environment is always diversified. Not only do I freelance with the usual symphony and opera orchestras, I also work for theatres and private recording studios. As a result, I am constantly working with different groups of people, ranging from instrumentalists to singers, actors, directors and sound engineers. I have cherished all these opportunities that I have had and I was always comfortable finding my place in the team. The highlight of my career so far would be [Amadeus](https://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/shows/nt-at-home-amadeus) in the National Theatre, where I spent two years working and learning from this amazing team.
 
#### Detail Orientated/problem-solving
Wanting to be ***perfect*** is a huge part of a professional musician's life. In order to achieve this with my busy work life, I learned how to practice efficiently; this could be translated as: "narrow down the problem and try to understand it in order to solve it effectively".
 
#### Rapid learner
As a Maker, I have picked up the skills to learn new languages and technologies quickly, and this is a skill I am looking forward to developing throughout my career in technology. I also love finding out new things in my own time, by reading articles on Medium as well as practicing on Exercism.io, Codewars and Codecademy.
 
#### Artistic Vision
During my final project, I discovered a great passion for design. I have continued to explore the application of HTML, CSS and Bootstrap libraries in my projects - so that I can develop my skills across the full stack.
 
#### Multiculturalism
I love experiencing new cultures and having a multicultural workplace.
- Fluent in **Mandarin**, **Cantonese** and **English**, in the process of learning **Finnish**
- Have lived abroad for 18 years (New Zealand and United Kingdom)
