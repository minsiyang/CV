## Minsi Yang

I am a full-stack junior developer who is eagerly looking for a role where I can consolidate and expand my programming knowledge. 

After spending 20 years of playing music with different orchestras and ensembles around the world, I wanted a new challenge. Being a creative individual, and seeing how the music industry is doing quite poorly on their internet presence, I took the plunge to join the 16 weeks <a href="http://www.makersacademy.com/">Makers Academy</a> bootcamp.

Having recently completed the course, I have grown from a Luddite into a competent and confident junior developer. I love learning from making fun projects and the process of problem solving. I have also brought in the creativity and attention to details into my coding. I enjoy writing clean and well tested code and this is my biggest priority in looking for a junior developer role. I'd love to work in a supportive environment where those practices are followed.
