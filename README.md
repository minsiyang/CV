## Minsi Yang

I am a full-stack junior developer who is eagerly looking for a role where I can consolidate and expand my programming knowledge. 

After spending 20 years of playing music with different orchestras and ensembles around the world, I wanted a new challenge. Being a creative individual, and seeing how the music industry is doing quite poorly on their internet presence, I took the plunge to join the 16 weeks [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/) bootcamp.

Having recently completed the course, I have grown from a Luddite into a competent and confident junior developer. I love learning from making fun projects and the process of problem solving. I have also brought in the creativity and attention to details into my coding. I enjoy writing clean and well tested code and this is my biggest priority in looking for a junior developer role. I'd love to work in a supportive environment where those practices are followed.

**Tech Skills:** Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, PostgreSQL, React.

## Skills

#### Thrives under pressure
From being a freelance musician, having to plan about travels from each perfomances, plan about amount of music that I have to learn and amount that I can sightread, and saving enough time to practice for furthing my own personal development; I have always thrives when working under pressure. It is my strong organisational and time management skills that I have developed over time that allows me to do this.

#### Team Player
After moving to London from New Zealand, the diversity of my work had a massive shift. Not only I freelance with the usual symphony and opera orchestras, I also work for theatres and doing private recordings. As a result, I was constantly working with different groups of people range from instrumentalists to singers, actors, directors and sound engineers, which I was always comfortable find my place in the team. Highlight of my career so far would be the [Amadeus](https://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/shows/nt-at-home-amadeus) in National Theatre where I spent two years to work and learn from this amazing group. 

#### Detail Orientated
Being almost ***perfect*** is a huge part of my professional music life, hence I practice, rehearse again and again for some minor details of the music to preserve that precious moment on stage. This also comes through in my code, as I enjoy refactoring to make my code simple and easy to read, as well as a good debugging session for peers.
